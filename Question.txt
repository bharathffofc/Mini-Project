Project: Simple Notes Manager API Description: (Mini project title)
Build a REST API using FastAPI to manage personal notes. Each note has a title, content, and tags.
Notes are stored as JSON files on disk, while metadata (title, tags, file path) is stored in MongoDB.

Requirements:
 - Use FastAPI for CRUD endpoints: create, read all, read one, update, delete.
 - Use an abstract base class 'BaseNote' with save(), load(), delete() methods.
 - Implement a JSONNote class that uses file handling.
 - Use custom exceptions for missing/invalid notes.
 - Use list comprehension to filter notes by tag.
 - Use Git for version control
 -add a recycle bin-like option to bring back deleted notes if needed
